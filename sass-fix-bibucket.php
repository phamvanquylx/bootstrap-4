Open target file, followed by the command palette. Enter SFTP: Monitor File (Upload on External Save)

Start whatever CLI watch/build utility you prefer, for me, Sass: sass --watch app.scss:app.css

Leave target file open, otherwise the SFTP monitor seems to cease.


// sass --watch template.scss:template.css  --- file scss
